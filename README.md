# AUTO-PLU-JUL-2022-

## Intro
NCR SelfServ-CheckOut (SSCO) Machine allows Customer to complete it's shopping without Store Supervisors involvement.This helps things done quickly, faster and automated kind of ways.

## Problem Statement
If we update any field on server related to items or just the positions of Categories we need to manually go to Store Authorization and do Reload Option to update those things.

## My Role
1. Design and write the code to make reload automated within some time range.
2. Ownership of this feature and future issues related to this feature.
3. To assist the team in reaching project goals
4. Able to find impacted areas with mine code changes


## My Contributions
1. Minimal Code changes to make this feature working and without disturbing base flow much.
2. Configurable feature
3. Configurable Timer to trigger automated reload options 
4. Resolving bugs which came due to some conflicts with new flow and already working one.
5. Guided QA about the bottleneck areas so testing can be improved for those scenarios.

## Timeline
This Feature got implemented within 25 days and extra 5 days to solve future bugs came during testing.

## Outcome
Implemented correctly and good appreciation from Customer since there were complexities since we are handling thing which are located to server and putting an exact timer to make it work and this should only happen when SSCO is in idle mode since we don't want Customer to have any problem during their transactions.
